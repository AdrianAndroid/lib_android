# Issue Lifecycle and Reporting Guidelines

[TOC]

## Issue tracker {#tracker}

The public-facing issue tracker URL is
[issuetracker.google.com](https://issuetracker.google.com). If you visit this
URL from a Google-internal account, it will immediately redirect you to the
internal-facing issue tracker URL. Make sure that any links you paste publicly
have the correct public-facing URL.

The top-level Jetpack component is
[`Android Public Tracker > App Development > Jetpack (androidx)`](https://issuetracker.google.com/components/192731/manage#basic).

## Reporting guidelines {#reporting}

Issue Tracker isn't a developer support forum. For support information, consider
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com).

Support for Google apps is through
[Google's support site](http://support.google.com/). Support for third-party
apps is provided by the app's developer, for example through the contact
information provided on Google Play.

1.  Search for your bug to see if anyone has already reported it. Don't forget
    to search for all issues, not just open ones, as your issue might already
    have been reported and closed. To help you find the most popular results,
    sort the result by number of stars.

1.  If you find your issue and it's important to you, star it! The number of
    stars on a bug helps us know which bugs are most important to fix.

1.  If no one has reported your bug, file the bug. First, browse for the correct
    component -- typically this has a 1:1 correspondence with Maven group ID --
    and fill out the provided template.

1.  Include as much information in the bug as you can, following the
    instructions for the bug queue that you're targeting. A bug that simply says
    something isn't working doesn't help much, and will probably be closed
    without any action. The amount of detail that you provide, such as a minimal
    sample project, log files, repro steps, and even a patch set, helps us
    address your issue.

## Issue lifecycle

1.  When an issue is reported, it is set to `Assigned` status for default
    assignee (typically the [library owner](owners.md)) with a priority of
    **P4**.
1.  Once an issue has been triaged by the assignee, its priority will be raised
    from **P4** according to severity.
1.  The issue may still be reassigned at this point.
    [Bug bounty](onboarding.md#bug-bounty) issues are likely to change
    assignees.
1.  A status of **Accepted** means the assignee is actively working on the
    issue.
1.  A status of **Fixed** means that the issue has been resolved in the
    development branch. Please note that it may take some time for the fix to
    propagate into various release channels (internal repositories, Google
    Maven, etc.). **Do not** re-open an issue because the fix has not yet
    propagated into a specific release channel. **Do not** re-open an issue that
    has been fixed unless the fix was reverted or the exact reported issue is
    still occurring.
