/**
 * Denotes that the annotated element is a marker of an experimental API.
 *
 * Any declaration annotated with this marker is considered part of an unstable API surface and its
 * call sites should accept the experimental aspect of it either by using [UseExperimental],
 * or by being annotated with that marker themselves, effectively causing further propagation of
 * that experimental aspect.
 *
 * Example:
 * <pre>`
 * // Library code
 * &#64;Retention(CLASS)
 * &#64;Target({TYPE, METHOD, CONSTRUCTOR, FIELD, PACKAGE})
 * &#64;Experimental(level = Level.ERROR)
 * public @interface ExperimentalDateTime {}
 *
 * &#64;ExperimentalDateTime
 * public class DateProvider {
 * // ...
 * }
`</pre> *
 *
 * <pre>`
 * // Client code
 * int getYear() {
 * DateProvider provider; // Error: DateProvider is experimental
 * // ...
 * }
 *
 * &#64;ExperimentalDateTime
 * Date getDate() {
 * DateProvider provider; // OK: the function is marked as experimental
 * // ...
 * }
 *
 * void displayDate() {
 * System.out.println(getDate()); // Error: getDate() is experimental, acceptance is required
 * }
