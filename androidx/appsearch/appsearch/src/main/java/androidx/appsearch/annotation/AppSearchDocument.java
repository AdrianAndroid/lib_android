/**
 * Marks a class as a data class known to AppSearch.
 *
 * <p>Each field annotated with {@link Property @Property} will become an AppSearch searchable
 * property. Fields annotated with other annotations included here (like {@link Uri @Uri}) will have
 * the special behaviour described in that annotation. All other members (those which do not have
 * any of these annotations) will be ignored by AppSearch and will not be persisted or set.
 *
 * <p>Each AppSearch field, whether marked by {@link Property @Property} or by one of the other
 * annotations here, must meet at least one the following conditions:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>There must be a getter named get&lt;Fieldname&gt; in the class (with package-private
 *     visibility or greater), or
 *     <li>The field itself must have package-private visibility or greater.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The field must also meet at least one of the following conditions:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>There must be a setter named set&lt;Fieldname&gt; in the class (with package-private
 *     visibility or greater), or
 *     <li>The field itself must be mutable (non-final) and have package-private visibility or
 *     greater, or
 *     <li>There must be a constructor that accepts all fields not meeting condition 1. and 2. as
 *     parameters. That constructor must have package-private visibility or greater. It may
 *     also accept fields that do meet conditions 1 and 2, in which case the constructor will be
 *     used to populate those fields instead of methods 1 and 2.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The class must also have exactly one member annotated with {@link Uri @Uri}.
