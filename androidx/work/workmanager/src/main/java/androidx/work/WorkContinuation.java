/**
 * A class that allows you to chain together {@link OneTimeWorkRequest}s.  WorkContinuations allow
 * the user to create arbitrary acyclic graphs of work dependencies.  You can add dependent work to
 * a WorkContinuation by invoking {@link #then(OneTimeWorkRequest)} or its variants.  This returns a
 * new WorkContinuation.
 * <p>
 * To construct more complex graphs, {@link WorkContinuation#combine(List)} or its
 * variants can be used to return a WorkContinuation with the input WorkContinuations as
 * prerequisites.  To create a graph like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     A       C
 *     |       |
 *     B       D
 *     |       |
 *     +-------+
 *         |
 *         E    </pre>
 *
 * you would write the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *  WorkContinuation left = workManager.beginWith(A).then(B);
 *  WorkContinuation right = workManager.beginWith(C).then(D);
 *  WorkContinuation final = WorkContinuation.combine(Arrays.asList(left, right)).then(E);
 *  final.enqueue();}</pre>
 *
 * Not that enqueuing a WorkContinuation enqueues all previously-unenqueued prerequisites.  You must
 * call {@link #enqueue()} to inform WorkManager to actually enqueue the work graph.  As usual,
 * enqueues are asynchronous - you can observe or block on the returned {@link Operation} if you
 * need to be informed about its completion.
 * <p>
 * Because of the fluent nature of this class, its existence should be invisible in most cases.
