/**
 * QualitySelector defines the desired quality setting.
 *
 * <p>There are pre-defined quality constants that are universally used for video, such as
 * {@link #QUALITY_SD}, {@link #QUALITY_HD}, {@link #QUALITY_FHD} and {@link #QUALITY_UHD}, but
 * not all of them are supported on every device since each device has its own capabilities.
 * {@link #isQualitySupported(CameraInfo, int)} can be used to check whether a quality is
 * supported on the device or not and {@link #getResolution(CameraInfo, int)} can be used to get
 * the actual resolution defined in the device. Aside from checking the qualities one by one,
 * QualitySelector provides a more convenient way to select a quality. The typical usage of
 * selecting a single desired quality is:
 * <pre>
 *     <code>
 * QualitySelector qualitySelector = QualitySelector.of(QualitySelector.QUALITY_FHD)
 *     </code>
 * </pre>
 * Or the usage of selecting a series of qualities by desired order:
 * <pre>
 *     <code>
 * QualitySelector qualitySelector = QualitySelector
 *         .firstTry(QualitySelector.QUALITY_FHD)
 *         .thenTry(QualitySelector.QUALITY_HD)
 *         .finallyTry(QualitySelector.QUALITY_SHD)
 *     </code>
 * </pre>
 * The recommended way to set the {@link Procedure#finallyTry(int)} is giving guaranteed supported
 * qualities such as {@link #QUALITY_LOWEST} and {@link #QUALITY_HIGHEST}, which ensures the
 * QualitySelector can always choose a supported quality. Another way to ensure a quality will be
 * selected when none of the desired qualities are supported is to use
 * {@link Procedure#finallyTry(int, int)} with an open-ended fallback strategy such as
 * {@link #FALLBACK_STRATEGY_LOWER}:
 * <pre>
 *     <code>
 * QualitySelector qualitySelector = QualitySelector
 *         .firstTry(QualitySelector.QUALITY_UHD)
 *         .finallyTry(QualitySelector.QUALITY_FHD, FALLBACK_STRATEGY_LOWER)
 *     </code>
 * </pre>
 * If QUALITY_UHD and QUALITY_FHD are not supported on the device, QualitySelector will select
 * the quality that is closest to and lower than QUALITY_FHD. If no lower quality is supported,
 * the quality that is closest to and higher than QUALITY_FHD will be selected.
 * {@link #select(CameraInfo)} can be used to obtain the final result quality based on the desired
 * qualities and fallback strategy, {@link #QUALITY_NONE} will be returned if all desired
 * qualities are not supported and fallback strategy also cannot result in a supported quality.
