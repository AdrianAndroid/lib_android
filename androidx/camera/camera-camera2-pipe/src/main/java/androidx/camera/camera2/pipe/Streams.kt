/**
 * A [CameraStream] is used on a [CameraGraph] to control what outputs that graph produces.
 *
 * - Each [CameraStream] must have a surface associated with it in the [CameraGraph]. This surface
 *   may be changed, although this may cause the camera to stall and reconfigure.
 * - [CameraStream]'s may be added to [Request]'s that are sent to the [CameraGraph]. This causes
 *   the associated surface to be used by the Camera to produce one or more of the outputs (defined
 *   by outputs.
 *
 * [CameraStream] may be configured in several different ways with the requirement that each
 * [CameraStream] may only represent a single surface that is sent to Camera2, and that each
 * [CameraStream] must produce one or more distinct outputs.
 *
 * There are three main components that will be wired together, the [CameraStream], the
 * Camera2 [OutputConfiguration], and the [OutputStream]'s. In each of these examples a
 * [CameraStream] is associated with a distinct surface that may be sent to camera2 to produce 1
 * or more distinct outputs defined in the list of [OutputStream]'s.
 *
 * Simple 1:1 configuration
 *   ```
 *   CameraStream-1 -> OutputConfig-1 -> OutputStream-1
 *   CameraStream-2 -> OutputConfig-2 -> OutputStream-2
 *   ```
 *
 * Stream sharing (Multiple surfaces use the same OutputConfig object)
 *   ```
 *   CameraStream-1 --------------------> OutputStream-1
 *                  >- OutputConfig-1 -<
 *   CameraStream-2 --------------------> OutputStream-2
 *   ```
 *
 * Multi-Output / External OutputConfiguration (Camera2 may produce one or more of the outputs)
 *   ```
 *   CameraStream-1 -> OutputConfig-1 -> OutputStream-1
 *                 \-> OutputConfig-2 -> OutputStream-2
 *   ```
