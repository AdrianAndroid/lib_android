/**
 * An instance of a [RequestProcessor] exists for the duration of a CameraCaptureSession and must be
 * created for each new CameraCaptureSession. It is responsible for low level interactions with the
 * CameraCaptureSession and for shimming the interfaces and callbacks to make them easier to work
 * with.
 *
 * There are some important design considerations:
 * - Instances class is not thread safe, and must be synchronized outside of this class.
 * - Implementations can and will assume that calls will not overlap across threads.
 * - Implementations must take special care to reduce the number objects and wrappers that are
 *   created, and to reduce the number of loops and overhead in wrapper objects. Its better to do
 *   work during initialization than during a callback.
 * - Implementations are expected to interact directly, and synchronously, with the Camera.
 * - Callbacks are expected to be invoked at *very* high frequency.
 * - One RequestProcessor instance per CameraCaptureSession
