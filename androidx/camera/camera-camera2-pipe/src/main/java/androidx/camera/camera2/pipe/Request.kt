 * [Request] objects are handled by camera2 via the [RequestProcessor] interface, and will
 * translate each [Request] object into a corresponding [CaptureRequest] object using the active
 * [CameraDevice], [CameraCaptureSession], and [CameraGraph.Config]. Requests may be queued up and
 * submitted after a delay, or reused (in the case of repeating requests) if the
 * [CameraCaptureSession] is reconfigured or recreated.
 *
 * Depending on the [CameraGraph.Config], it is possible that not all parameters that are set on
 * the [Request] will be honored when a [Request] is sent to the camera. Specifically, Camera2
 * parameters related to 3A State and any required parameters specified on the [CameraGraph.Config]
 * will override parameters specified in a [Request]
 *
