/**
 * A wakelock is a thread-safe primitive that can invoke close after all tokens are released.
 *
 * This implementation has several defining characteristics:
 * 1. The timeout (if specified), does not start until at least 1 [Token] has been acquired.
 * 2. Acquiring a token a token at any time before the timeout completes will cancel the timeout.
 * 3. Acquiring a token is atomic: Either a token is acquired and the close method will not execute
 *    OR acquire will return a token and the close method will not execute until after the token is
 *    released.
