 *

 * no value that results in an accessible contrast ratio. Because alpha is limited to [0,1], 7
 * steps results in a precision of ~0.01, since log2(1/0.01) â‰ˆ 7.
 *
 * Note: binary searching here is chosen since it is not possible to 'solve' for alpha, since the
 * transformation from color -> contrast ratio is not linear (the gamma exponent for sRGB colors
 * is 2.4). We can approximate this to 2, but this results in not that accurate solutions, and we
 * need to guarantee that they are at least above [DesiredContrastRatio] - falling just below is
