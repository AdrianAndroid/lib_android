 * The [position] represents the position of the pointer relative to the element that
 * this [PointerInputChange] is being dispatched to.
 *
 * The [previousPosition] represents the position of the pointer offset to the current
 * position of the pointer relative to the screen.
 *
 * This means that [position] and [previousPosition] can always be used to understand how
 * much a pointer has moved relative to an element, even if that element is moving along with the
 * changes to the pointer.  For example, if a pointer touches a 1x1 pixel box in the middle,
 * [position] will report a position of (0, 0) when dispatched to it.  If the next event
 * moves x position 5 pixels, [position] will report (5, 0) and [previousPosition] will
 * report (0, 0). If the box moves all 5 pixels, and the next event represents the pointer moving
 * along the x axis for 5 more pixels, [position] will again report (5, 0) and
 * [previousPosition] will report (0, 0).
 *
 * @param id The unique id of the pointer associated with this [PointerInputChange].
 * @param uptimeMillis The time of the current pointer event, in milliseconds. The start (`0`) time
 * is platform-dependent
 * @param position The [Offset] of the current pointer event, relative to the containing
 * element
 * @param pressed `true` if the pointer event is considered "pressed." For example, finger
 * touching the screen or a mouse button is pressed [pressed] would be `true`.
 * @param previousUptimeMillis The [uptimeMillis] of the previous pointer event
 * @param previousPosition The [Offset] of the previous pointer event, offset to the
 * [position] and relative to the containing element.
 * @param previousPressed `true` if the pointer event was considered "pressed." For example , if
 * a finger was touching the screen or a mouse button was pressed, [previousPressed] would be
 * `true`.
 * @param consumed Which aspects of this change have been consumed.
 * @param type The device type that produced the event, such as [mouse][PointerType.Mouse],

 * [PointerInputChange]s. This is the primary path where descendants will interact with
 * [PointerInputChange]s before parents. This allows for buttons to respond to a tap before a
 * container of the bottom to respond to a tap.
 * 3. Final: This pass is where children can learn what aspects of [PointerInputChange]s were
 * consumed by parents during the [Main] pass. For example, this is how a button determines that
 * it should no longer respond to fingers lifting off of it because a parent scroller has
 * consumed movement in a [PointerInputChange].
