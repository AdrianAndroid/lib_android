 * The provided lambda receiver scope provides "key = value"-style setters for any
 * [SemanticsPropertyKey]. Additionally, chaining multiple semantics modifiers is
 * also a supported style.
 *
 * The resulting semantics produce two [SemanticsNode] trees:
 *
 * The "unmerged tree" rooted at [SemanticsOwner.unmergedRootSemanticsNode] has one
 * [SemanticsNode] per layout node which has any [SemanticsModifier] on it.  This [SemanticsNode]
 * contains all the properties set in all the [SemanticsModifier]s on that node.
 *
 * The "merged tree" rooted at [SemanticsOwner.rootSemanticsNode] has equal-or-fewer nodes: it
 * simplifies the structure based on [mergeDescendants] and [clearAndSetSemantics].  For most
 * purposes (especially accessibility, or the testing of accessibility), the merged semantics
 * tree should be used.
 *
 * @param mergeDescendants Whether the semantic information provided by the owning component and
 * its descendants should be treated as one logical entity.
 * Most commonly set on screen-reader-focusable items such as buttons or form fields.
 * In the merged semantics tree, all descendant nodes (except those themselves marked
 * [mergeDescendants]) will disappear from the tree, and their properties will get merged
 * into the parent's configuration (using a merging algorithm that varies based on the type
 * of property -- for example, text properties will get concatenated, separated by commas).
 * In the unmerged semantics tree, the node is simply marked with
 * [SemanticsConfiguration.isMergingSemanticsOfDescendants].
 * @param properties properties to add to the semantics. [SemanticsPropertyReceiver] will be
 * provided in the scope to allow access for common properties and its values.
