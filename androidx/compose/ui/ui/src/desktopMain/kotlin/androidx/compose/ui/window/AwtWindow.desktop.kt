/**
 * Compose [Window] obtained from [create]. The [create] block will be called
 * exactly once to obtain the [Window] to be composed, and it is also guaranteed to be invoked on
 * the UI thread (Event Dispatch Thread).
 *
 * Once [AwtWindow] leaves the composition, [dispose] will be called to free resources that
 * obtained by the [Window].
 *
 * The [update] block can be run multiple times (on the UI thread as well) due to recomposition,
 * and it is the right place to set [Window] properties depending on state.
 * When state changes, the block will be reexecuted to set the new properties.
 * Note the block will also be ran once right after the [create] block completes.
 *
 * [AwtWindow] is needed for creating window's / dialog's that still can't be created with
 * the default Compose functions [androidx.compose.ui.window.Window] or
 * [androidx.compose.ui.window.Dialog].
 *
 * This API is experimental and will eventually replace [AppWindow] / [AppManager].
 *
 * @param visible Is [Window] visible to user.
 * Note that if we set `false` - native resources will not be released. They will be released
 * only when [Window] will leave the composition.
 * @param create The block creating the [Window] to be composed.
 * @param dispose The block to dispose [Window] and free native resources. Usually it is simple
 * `Window::dispose`
 * @param update The callback to be invoked after the layout is inflated.

        // This happens in the when we create a modal dialog.

        // will block coroutine.

        // We achieve the correct order when we open nested
        // window at the same time when we open the parent window. If we would show the window
        // immediately we will have this sequence in case of nested Window's:
        //
        // 1. window1.setContent
        // 2. window2.setContent
        // 3. window2.isVisible = true
