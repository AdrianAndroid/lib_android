// TODO(demin): support focus management
/**
 * Composes platform window in the current composition. When Window enters the composition,
 * a new platform window will be created and receives the focus. When Window leaves the
 * composition, window will be disposed and closed.
 *
 * Initial size of the window is controlled by [WindowState.size].
 * Initial position of the window is controlled by [WindowState.position].
 *
 * Usage in single-window application ([ApplicationScope.exitApplication] will close all the
 * windows and stop all effects defined in [application]):
 * ```
 * fun main() = application {
 *     Window(onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * or if it only needed to close the main window without closing all other opened windows:
 * ```
 * fun main() = application {
 *     val isOpen by remember { mutableStateOf(true) }
 *     if (isOpen) {
 *         Window(onCloseRequest = { isOpen = false })
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param onCloseRequest Callback that will be called when the user closes the window.
 * Usually in this callback we need to manually tell Compose what to do:
 * - change `isOpen` state of the window (which is manually defined)
 * - close the whole application (`onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication` in [ApplicationScope])
 * - don't close the window on close request (`onCloseRequest = {}`)
 * @param state The state object to be used to control or observe the window's state
 * When size/position/status is changed by the user, state will be updated.
 * When size/position/status of the window is changed by the application (changing state),
 * the native window will update its corresponding properties.
 * If application changes, for example [WindowState.placement], then after the next
 * recomposition, [WindowState.size] will be changed to correspond the real size of the window.
 * If [WindowState.position] is not [WindowPosition.isSpecified], then after the first show on the
 * screen [WindowState.position] will be set to the absolute values.
 * @param visible Is [Window] visible to user.
 * If `false`:
 * - internal state of [Window] is preserved and will be restored next time the window
 * will be visible;
 * - native resources will not be released. They will be released only when [Window]
 * will leave the composition.
 * @param title Title in the titlebar of the window
 * @param icon Icon in the titlebar of the window (for platforms which support this)
 * @param resizable Can window be resized by the user (application still can resize the window
 * changing [state])
 * @param enabled Can window react to input events
 * @param focusable Can window receive focus
 * @param alwaysOnTop Should window always be on top of another windows
 * @param onPreviewKeyEvent This callback is invoked when the user interacts with the hardware
 * keyboard. It gives ancestors of a focused component the chance to intercept a [KeyEvent].
 * Return true to stop propagation of this event. If you return false, the key event will be
 * sent to this [onPreviewKeyEvent]'s child. If none of the children consume the event,
 * it will be sent back up to the root using the onKeyEvent callback.
 * @param onKeyEvent This callback is invoked when the user interacts with the hardware
 * keyboard. While implementing this callback, return true to stop propagation of this event.
 * If you return false, the key event will be sent to this [onKeyEvent]'s parent.
 * @param content Content of the window
 *
 * This API is experimental and will eventually replace [AppWindow] / [AppManager]

/**
 * Compose [ComposeWindow] obtained from [create]. The [create] block will be called

 *
 * Once Window leaves the composition, [dispose] will be called to free resources that
 * obtained by the [ComposeWindow].
 *
 * The [update] block can be run multiple times (on the UI thread as well) due to recomposition,
 * and it is the right place to set [ComposeWindow] properties depending on state.
 * When state changes, the block will be reexecuted to set the new properties.
 * Note the block will also be ran once right after the [create] block completes.
 *
 * Window is needed for creating window's that still can't be created with
 * the default Compose function [androidx.compose.ui.window.Window]
 *
 * This API is experimental and will eventually replace [AppWindow] / [AppManager].
 *
 * @param visible Is [ComposeWindow] visible to user.
 * If `false`:
 * - internal state of [ComposeWindow] is preserved and will be restored next time the window
 * will be visible;
 * - native resources will not be released. They will be released only when [Window]
 * will leave the composition.
