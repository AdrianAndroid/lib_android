/**
 * Defines what happens at the edge of the gradient.
 * A gradient is defined along a finite inner area. In the case of a linear
 * gradient, it's between the parallel lines that are orthogonal to the line
 * drawn between two points. In the case of radial gradients, it's the disc
 * that covers the circle centered on a particular point up to a given radius.
 *
 * This enum is used to define how the gradient should paint the regions
 * outside that defined inner area.
 *
 * See also:
 * [LinearGradientShader], [RadialGradientShader] which works in
 * relative coordinates and can create a [Shader] representing the gradient
 * for a particular [Rect] on demand.
