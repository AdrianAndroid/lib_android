/**
 * Saves a copy of the current transform and clip on the save stack, and then

 * lambda is executed and the save stack is popped, the group will be flattened into
 * a layer and have the given `paint`'s [Paint.colorFilter] and [Paint.blendMode]
 * applied.
 *
 * This lets you create composite effects, for example making a group of
 * drawing commands semi-transparent. Without using [Canvas.saveLayer], each part of
 * the group would be painted individually, so where they overlap would be
 * darker than where they do not. By using [Canvas.saveLayer] to group them
 * together, they can be drawn with an opaque color at first, and then the
 * entire group can be made transparent using the [Canvas.saveLayer]'s paint.
 *
 *
 * ## Using saveLayer with clips
 *
 * When a rectangular clip operation (from [Canvas.clipRect]) is not axis-aligned
 * with the raster buffer, or when the clip operation is not rectalinear (e.g.
 * because it is a rounded rectangle clip created by [Canvas.clipPath]), the edge of the
 * clip needs to be anti-aliased.
 *
 * If two draw calls overlap at the edge of such a clipped region, without
 * using [Canvas.saveLayer], the first drawing will be anti-aliased with the
 * background first, and then the second will be anti-aliased with the result
 * of blending the first drawing and the background. On the other hand, if
 * [Canvas.saveLayer] is used immediately after establishing the clip, the second
 * drawing will cover the first in the layer, and thus the second alone will
 * be anti-aliased with the background when the layer is clipped and
 * composited (when lambda is finished executing).
 *
 * ## Performance considerations
 *
 * Generally speaking, [Canvas.saveLayer] is relatively expensive.
 *
 * There are a several different hardware architectures for GPUs (graphics
 * processing units, the hardware that handles graphics), but most of them
 * involve batching commands and reordering them for performance. When layers
 * are used, they cause the rendering pipeline to have to switch render
 * target (from one layer to another). Render target switches can flush the
 * GPU's command buffer, which typically means that optimizations that one
 * could get with larger batching are lost. Render target switches also
 * generate a lot of memory churn because the GPU needs to copy out the
 * current frame buffer contents from the part of memory that's optimized for
 * writing, and then needs to copy it back in once the previous render target
 * (layer) is restored.
 *
 * See also:
 *
 *  * [Canvas.save], which saves the current state, but does not create a new layer
 *    for subsequent commands.
 *  * [BlendMode], which discusses the use of [Paint.blendMode] with
 *    [saveLayer].
