/**
 * The receiver scope for injecting gestures on the [semanticsNode] identified by the
 * corresponding [SemanticsNodeInteraction]. Gestures can be injected by calling methods defined
 * on [GestureScope], such as [click] or [swipe]. The [SemanticsNodeInteraction] can be found by
 * one of the finder methods such as
 * [ComposeTestRule.onNode][androidx.compose.ui.test.junit4.ComposeTestRule.onNode].
 *
 * The functions in [GestureScope] can roughly be divided into two groups: full gestures and
 * individual touch events. The individual touch events are: [down], [move] and friends, [up]
 * and [cancel]. Full gestures are all the other functions, like [click], [doubleClick],
 * [swipe], etc. See the documentation of [down] for more information about individual events. If
 * you execute a full gesture while in the middle of another gesture, an [IllegalStateException]
 * or [IllegalArgumentException] can be thrown when the pointerId is unintentionally used for
 * both gestures. If you want to perform e.g. a click during a partially performed gesture, make
 * sure they use different pointer ids.
 *
 * Note that all events generated by the gesture methods are batched together and sent as a whole
 * after [performGesture] has executed its code block.
 *
 * Next to the functions, [GestureScope] also exposes several properties that allow you to get
 * [coordinates][Offset] within a node, like the [top left corner][topLeft], its [center], or
 * some percentage of the size ([percentOffset]).
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * onNodeWithTag("myWidget")
 *    .performGesture {
 *        click(center)
 *    }
 *
 * onNodeWithTag("myWidget")
 *    // Perform an L-shaped gesture
 *    .performGesture {
 *        down(topLeft)
 *        move(topLeft + percentOffset(0f, .1f))
 *        move(topLeft + percentOffset(0f, .2f))
 *        move(topLeft + percentOffset(0f, .3f))
 *        move(topLeft + percentOffset(0f, .4f))
 *        move(centerLeft)
 *        move(centerLeft + percentOffset(.1f, 0f))
 *        move(centerLeft + percentOffset(.2f, 0f))
 *        move(centerLeft + percentOffset(.3f, 0f))
 *        move(centerLeft + percentOffset(.4f, 0f))
 *        move(center)

/**
 * Sends a down event for the pointer with the given [pointerId] at [position] on the associated
 * node. The [position] is in the node's local coordinate system, where (0, 0) is
 * the top left corner of the node.
 *
 * If no pointers are down yet, this will start a new gesture. If a gesture is
 * already in progress, this event is sent with at the same timestamp as the last event. If the
 * given pointer is already down, an [IllegalArgumentException] will be thrown.
 *
 * Subsequent events for this or other gestures can be spread out over both this and future
 * invocations of [performGesture]. An entire gesture starts with a [down][down] event,
 * followed by several down, move or up events, and ends with an [up][up] or a
 * [cancel][cancel] event. Movement can be expressed with [moveTo] and [moveBy] to
 * move a single pointer at a time, or [movePointerTo] and [movePointerBy] to move multiple
 * pointers at a time. The `movePointer[To|By]` methods do not send the move event directly, use
 * [move] to send the move event. Some other methods can send a move event as well. All
 * events, regardless the method used, will always contain the current position of _all_ pointers.
 *
 * Down and up events are sent at the same time as the previous event, but will send an extra
 * move event just before the down or up event if [movePointerTo] or [movePointerBy] has been
 * called and no move event has been sent yet. This does not happen for cancel events, but the
 * cancel event will contain the up to date position of all pointers. Move and cancel events will
 * advance the event time by 10 milliseconds.
 *
 * Because gestures don't have to be defined all in the same [performGesture] block,
 * keep in mind that while the gesture is not complete, all code you execute in between
 * blocks that progress the gesture, will be executed while imaginary fingers are actively
 * touching the screen.
 *
 * In the context of testing, it is not necessary to complete a gesture with an up or cancel
 * event, if the test ends before it expects the finger to be lifted from the screen.
