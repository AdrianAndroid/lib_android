package androidx.compose.ui.test

/**
 * Represents a resource of an application under test which can cause asynchronous background
 * work to happen during test execution (e.g. an http request in response to a button click).
 *
 * By default, all interactions from the test with the compose tree (finding nodes, performing
 * gestures, making assertions) will be synchronized with pending work in Compose's internals
 * (such as applying state changes, recomposing, measuring, etc). This ensures that the UI is in
 * a stable state when the interactions are performed, so that e.g. no pending recompositions are
 * still scheduled that could potentially change the UI. However, any asynchronous work that is
 * not done through one of Compose's mechanisms won't be included in the default synchronization.
 * For such work, test authors can create an [IdlingResource] and register it into the test with
 * [registerIdlingResource][androidx.compose.ui.test.junit4.ComposeTestRule
 * .registerIdlingResource], and the interaction will wait for that resource to become idle prior
 * to performing it.

     * idling resources until they are all idle.
