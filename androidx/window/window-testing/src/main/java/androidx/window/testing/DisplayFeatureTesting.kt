/**
 * A convenience method to get a test fold with default values provided. With the default values
 * it returns a [FoldingFeature.State.HALF_OPENED] feature that splits the screen along the
 * [FoldingFeature.Orientation.HORIZONTAL] axis.
 *
 * The bounds of the feature are calculated based on [orientation] and [size]. If the
 * feature is [VERTICAL] then the feature is centered horizontally. The top-left x-coordinate is
 * center - ([size] / 2) and the top-right x-coordinate is center + ([size] / 2). If the feature is
 * [HORIZONTAL] then the feature is centered vertically. The top-left y-coordinate is center -
 * ([size] / 2) and the bottom-left y-coordinate is center - ([size] / 2). The folding features
 * always cover the window in one dimension and that determines the other coordinates.
 *
 * @param activity that will house the [FoldingFeature].
 * @param size the smaller dimension  of the fold. The larger dimension  always covers the entire
 * window.
 * @param state [State] of the fold. The default value is [HALF_OPENED]
 * @param orientation [Orientation] of the fold. The default value is [HORIZONTAL]
 * @return [FoldingFeature] that is splitting if the width is not 0 and runs parallel to the
 * [Orientation] axis.
