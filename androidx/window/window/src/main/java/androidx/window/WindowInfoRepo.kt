     * runtime such as a user attaching a secondary display and moving an [Activity] that is in
     * as a result of display or display size change. In some cases the change of maximum metrics
     * will not result in current metrics and configuration change. For example, if a floating
     * window is moved between displays.
     *
     * The metrics describe the size of the largest potential area the window might occupy with
     * [MATCH_PARENT][android.view.WindowManager.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT] width and height
     * and any combination of flags that would allow the window to extend behind display cutouts.
     *
     * The value of this is based on the largest **potential** windowing state of the system.
     * For example, for activities in multi-window mode the metrics returned are based on what the
     * bounds would be if the user expanded the window to cover the entire screen.
     *
     * Note that this might still be smaller than the size of the physical display if certain
     * areas of the display are not available to windows created for the associated [Context].
     * For example, devices with foldable displays that wrap around the enclosure may split the
     * physical display into different regions, one for the front and one for the back, each acting
     * as different logical displays. In this case [maximumWindowMetrics] would return
     * the region describing the side of the device the associated [context's][Context]
     * window is placed.
