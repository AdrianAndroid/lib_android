import androidx.sqlite.db.SupportSQLiteDatabase

/**
 * Creates [Migration] from [startVersion] to [endVersion] that runs [migrate] to perform
 * the necessary migrations.
 *
 * A migration can handle more than 1 version (e.g. if you have a faster path to choose when
 * going version 3 to 5 without going to version 4). If Room opens a database at version
 * 3 and latest version is < 5, Room will use the migration object that can migrate from
 * 3 to 5 instead of 3 to 4 and 4 to 5.
 *
 * If there are not enough migrations provided to move from the current version to the latest
 * version, Room will clear the database and recreate so even if you have no changes between 2
 * versions, you should still provide a Migration object to the builder.
 *
 * [migrate] cannot access any generated Dao in this method.
 *
 * [migrate] is already called inside a transaction and that transaction
 * might actually be a composite transaction of all necessary `Migration`s.
