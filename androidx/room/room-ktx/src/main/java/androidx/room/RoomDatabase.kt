 * query executor. If the coroutine context is switched, suspending DAO functions will be able to
 * dispatch to the transaction thread.
 *
 * * The [TransactionElement] serves as an indicator for inherited context, meaning, if there is a
 * switch of context, suspending DAO methods will be able to use the indicator to dispatch the
 * database operation to the transaction thread.
 *
 * * The thread local element serves as a second indicator and marks threads that are used to
 * execute coroutines within the coroutine transaction, more specifically it allows us to identify
 * if a blocking DAO method is invoked within the transaction coroutine. Never assign meaning to
 * this value, for now all we care is if its present or not.
