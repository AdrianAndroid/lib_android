/**
 * Builds a LiveData that has values yielded from the given [block] that executes on a

 * If the [LiveData] becomes [inactive](LiveData.onInactive) while the [block] is executing, it
 * will be cancelled after [timeoutInMs] milliseconds unless the [LiveData] becomes active again
 * before that timeout (to gracefully handle cases like Activity rotation). Any value
 * [LiveDataScope.emit]ed from a cancelled [block] will be ignored.
 *
 * After a cancellation, if the [LiveData] becomes active again, the [block] will be re-executed
 * from the beginning. If you would like to continue the operations based on where it was stopped
 * last, you can use the [LiveDataScope.latestValue] function to get the last
 * [LiveDataScope.emit]ed value.

 * If the [block] completes successfully *or* is cancelled due to reasons other than [LiveData]

 * As a best practice, it is important for the [block] to cooperate in cancellation. See kotlin
 * coroutines documentation for details
 * https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/cancellation-and-timeouts.html.

 * The [timeoutInMs] can be changed to fit different use cases better, for example increasing it
 * will give more time to the [block] to complete even if [LiveData] is inactive. It is good for
 * cases when [block] is finite (meaning it can complete successfully) and is costly to restart.
 * Otherwise if a [block] is cheap to restart, decreasing the [timeoutInMs] value will allow to
