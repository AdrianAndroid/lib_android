# Places Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use the Car App Library to build an app that
allows searching, and displaying information for points of interest (POI)
using a map template.

It uses the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro) to
make the necessary queries.

In order for the sample to run correctly, a key for the Google Places API is needed. See [the documentation](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key)
for how to get a key, then add the key to the `strings.xml` file in the app's resources.
